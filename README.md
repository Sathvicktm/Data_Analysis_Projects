1. Corona Virus in different Countries
   The data scraped from the website, is converted to the csv-like format. Then this data is filtered to get the required statistics for the last 20 days and the visualizations are plotted(using matplotlib).

3. Salary Analysis
Load the Data: We use pandas to load and display the initial rows of the dataset.

Clean the Data: We check for and handle missing values. For simplicity, we drop rows where the salary is missing.

Visualize the Data: We use matplotlib and seaborn to create:

A histogram to show the distribution of salaries.
A box plot to compare salary distributions across departments.
A scatter plot to see the relationship between salary and years of experience.
Perform Basic Analysis:

Summary Statistics: Provides a quick overview of salary distribution.
Correlation: Shows the relationship between salary and years of experience.
Linear Regression: Helps to understand how years of experience might affect salary.
